# Magento JMeter Script
Originally designed for testing a specific module, these scripts will work fine as a basis toward load testing a base Magento installation

The scripts use two CSVs that should stay in the same directory as the script. These files contain credentials for the default frontend users that sample data installs. The admin users would need to be created as named in the admin_users.csv file
